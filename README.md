# Project and ticketing management system

This is a ticketing project using Rails and hosted on [Heroku](https://ticketing-app-et.herokuapp.com/).

Users can launch projects, and each project can have many tickets. These tickets come with a status and an assigned user. 

With these tickets, users are also able to make comments about the ticket, allowing different teams to collaborate with each other. Tickets can also be tagged to particular categories, allowing users to sort through different tickets easily.

Take a look at the website and see how it goes!
